## About Me

Hello! My name is Brendan Kelly-Ruetz. I am a recent graduate of the double degree program at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University, where I completed a Bachelor of Mathematics (double major in Actuarial Science & Statistics) and a Bachelor of Business Administration (concentration in Finance).

I am an aspiring Actuary who loves learning new things, especially related to risk and data science.

## My Projects

[Double Degree Class of 2021 Profile](https://brendankr.github.io/dd-2021-class-profile.pdf)

- This project was done in collaboration with **Jawad Khandoker**.
- In this project, we surveyed 42% of our graduating class on topics like demographics, academics, co-ops, lifestyle, and more. We then aggregated the responses, analyzed and visualized the results, and finally put together a final class profile in a slide format.
- To complete this project, we used Google Forms to conduct the survey, Microsoft Excel to aggregate and clean the data, Microsoft Power BI to create visualizations, and Microsoft PowerPoint to create the final profile.
